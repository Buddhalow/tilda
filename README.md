# tilda - 2d adventure game engine

(C) Copyright 2016 Alexander Forselius <drsounds@gmail.com>

Tilda is a 2d top scrolling html5 game engine written in ES6. 
It's gameplay is similar as older portable legend of zelda games, with own
tileset.

It is a game with on the fly editing, to faciliate quick game buildup during gameplay.

It is fully open source (MIT) and free. 

Work in progress

The gameplay is oriented by tao philosophy yin and yang, the player has a yin and yang property
and objects and maps also behaviour different depending on what yin/yang state the player has.

It reflects my belief in taoism and that the world shape differs slighly depending on what yin yang
status the player has. The plan is that using various items, the player can alter his yin/yang status,
and thus change the surrounding, and access different objects and locations, not unlike how the Rod of Season or Harp of Time works in legend of zelda

You start in a bungalow in thailand, and the story is going to be based on a similar timeline as 30 degrees in february.
